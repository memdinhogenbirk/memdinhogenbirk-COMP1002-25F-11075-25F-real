                                <p>In May 1940, American businessmen Martin Bromley, Irving Bromberg and James Humpert
                                    formed
                                    Standard Games in Honolulu, Hawaii. Their aim was to provide coin-operated amusement
                                    machines, including slot machines, to military bases as the increase in personnel
                                    with
                                    the
                                    onset of
                                    World War II would create demand for entertainment. After the war, the founders sold
                                    Standard
                                    Games in 1945, and established Service Games the next year, named for the military
                                    focus.
                                    After the
                                    US government outlawed slot machines in its territories in 1952, Bromley sent
                                    employees
                                    Richard
                                    Stewart and Ray LeMaire to Tokyo to establish Service Games of Japan to provide
                                    coin-operated slot machines to US bases in Japan.
                                    A year later, all five men established Service Games Panama to control the entities
                                    of
                                    Service Games worldwide.
                                    The company expanded over the next seven years to include distribution in South
                                    Korea,
                                    the
                                    Philippines, and South Vietnam.
                                    The name Sega, an abbreviation of Service Games, was first used in 1954 on a slot
                                    machine,
                                    the Diamond Star.</p>

                                <p>Due to notoriety arising from investigations by the US government into criminal
                                    business
                                    practices, Service Games of Japan was dissolved on May 31, 1960. On June 3, Bromley
                                    established two companies to take over its business activities, Nihon Goraku Bussan
                                    and
                                    Nihon Kikai Seizō. The two new companies purchased all of Service Games of Japan's
                                    assets.
                                    Kikai Seizō, doing business as Sega, Inc., focused on manufacturing slot machines.
                                    Goraku Bussan, doing business under Stewart as Utamatic, Inc., served as a
                                    distributor
                                    and
                                    operator of
                                    coin-operated machines, particularly jukeboxes. The companies merged in 1964,
                                    retaining the Nihon Goraku Bussan name.</p>

                                <p>Around the same time, David Rosen, an American officer in the United States Air Force
                                    stationed in Japan, launched a photo booth business in Tokyo in 1954. This company
                                    became
                                    Rosen
                                    Enterprises, and in 1957 began importing coin-operated games into Japan. In 1965,
                                    Nihon
                                    Goraku Bussan acquired Rosen Enterprises to form Sega Enterprises, Ltd. Rosen was
                                    installed
                                    as the
                                    CEO and managing director, while Stewart was named president and LeMaire was the
                                    director of
                                    planning. Shortly afterward, Sega stopped leasing to military bases and moved its
                                    focus
                                    from
                                    slot machines to coin-operated amusement machines. Its imports included Rock-Ola
                                    jukeboxes,
                                    pinball games by Williams, and gun games by Midway Manufacturing.
                                    Because Sega imported second-hand machines, which required frequent maintenance,
                                    it began constructing replacement guns and flippers for its imported games.</p>

                                <p>Originally, Sega launched its version of Periscope in 1966 as a three-player cabinet.
                                    As
                                    the
                                    latest in the industry's
                                    well-received genre of torpedo shooter games, Sega demonstrated it alongside such
                                    competition as slot machines, slot racing games, and pinball games at the 23rd
                                    London
                                    Amusement Trades Exhibition show in December and at the Hotel Equipment
                                    Exhibition in Paris in October 1967. It was popular at this sparsely attended Paris
                                    show,
                                    with daily earnings of Fr500 (Equating to 100USD in 1967).
                                    At the time, Periscope's large cabinet was cost-prohibitive for international
                                    export,
                                    but
                                    its popularity among distributors flying in to see the game prompted Sega to develop
                                    a
                                    smaller model for the worldwide market.</p>

                                <p>Sega's prototype location testing of a new, smaller, single-player version of
                                    Periscope
                                    occurred in Asia and Europe, and distributors were still enthusiastic about its
                                    performance.
                                    In full production by March 1968 and distributed
                                    internationally, the smaller single-player cabinet measured 6 feet (1.8 m) deep
                                    and more than 4 feet (1.2 m) wide, which was still larger and heavier than most
                                    games of
                                    the
                                    time. Periscope became a smash hit for Sega. The game was successful in Japan, and
                                    then
                                    in
                                    the US and Europe. It was awarded the Henry A. Gunther Trophy for the "most
                                    meritorious
                                    exhibit of coin-operated equipment" at the 1968 Parks Show.</p>
