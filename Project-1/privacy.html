                    <h3>(A) REGISTRATION INFORMATION</h3>

                    <p>Your registration information enables us to create your profile, provide you with access to our
                    Products and to give you access to your user preferences. This is necessary for the purpose of performing the
                    contract we have with you. It helps us to authenticate your access, to contact you for your views and to notify you
                    of important changes or updates to our Products.</p>

                    <p>If you choose to sign up for our Products using third party services such as your Facebook account,
                    that provider may provide your personal information with us subject to their privacy policy and the
                    privacy settings of your account with them. This may also enable the provider and us to link your activities with
                    your personal registration information at their site, and may include notifying your friends about your activities
                    while using our Products. If you sign up via third party services you should visit the third party website and
                    review their privacy policy and your registration profile or account to understand how your data is processed by
                    them and to find out what your options are.</p>

                    stores and Platform Operators, and to contact you to assist with resolving any problems with your purchases and
                    to process any refund payments that you may be due.</p>

                    <p>We will also use and analyze information on transactions on your account by data matching or
                    statistical analysis so that we can administer, support, improve and develop our business and to help us detect
                    and prevent fraud, or other illegal activities, or acts prohibited by our terms of service or any policies

                    detect and prevent fraud.</p>

                    <p>We use technical and device information to provide us with information, such as when an email is
                    opened, or to develop statistics on the effectiveness of advertising or marketing on our websites. In some cases,
                    working with third-party partners, we use this information to send you ads for our Products based on your
                    interests.</p>

                    <p>We also use technical and device information to operate and improve our Products, enable online
                    matchmaking, facilitate sharing, measure our effectiveness, set up and maintain accounts, identify and fix errors
                    and to help keep online content fair and safe and to resolve related disputes.</p>
                    <h3>(D) FEEDBACK / SURVEYS / USER RESEARCH</h3>

                    <p>We use your feedback to reply to your questions or queries, to provide customer support and resolve

                    <p>SEGA may also film and record user research sessions with your permission so that we can observe your playing

                    <p>SEGA may share data from user research sessions with certain third-party partners when there is a
                    legitimate business operation interest to do so. In such circumstances, your data will always be fully
                    anonymized before it is shared.</p>
                    <h3>(E) INFORMATION FROM PUBLICLY AVAILABLE ONLINE SOURCES</h3>

                    software updates for our Products. We use this data in order to analyze and produce statistics relating to the
                    habits, usage patterns and demographics of users as a group or as individuals. This allows us to deliver you

                    advertising, amongst other things.</p>

                    <p>We may also provide functionality within our Products which enables you to upload gameplay footage
                    to YouTube.</p>

                    <p>If you choose to use this feature, we will receive and store an authentication token from Google so
                    that the feature will operate properly. The use of this functionality is governed by YouTube's Terms of

                    <p>The anti-cheat/hacking technologies within your Product may require you to download certain data to
                    your device.</p>
                    <p>If you disable or otherwise tamper with these technologies, the Product may not operate properly and
                    you will be in breach of the applicable end user license agreement.</p>
                    <h3>(I) INFORMATION FROM LIVEOPS SOFTWARE</h3>

                    <h3>ONLINE ADVERTISING ON OUR WEBSITES AND NON-SEGA PROPERTIES</h3>

                    <p>We may allow third-party advertising technologies (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Google's
                    ad services, and others) on our Products that use cookies to deliver relevant and targeted content and
                    advertising to you on the Products and other websites you visit and applications you use. The ads may be based
                    on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, information you provide, your searches,
                    demographic data, and other information we collect about you. These ads may be based on your current activity or
                    your activity over time and across other websites and online services and may be tailored to your
                    interests.</p>
                    <p>See also our Cookies Policy for more information. We do not share your age or gender with third parties to
                    enable them to deliver targeted advertising to you based on your age or gender in our mobile apps, except that we
                    may inform third parties if we know that you are under the age of consent (see Section 8: Children's
                    Information).</p>

                    <p>The use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on devices you use to access
                    our Products by unaffiliated third parties is governed by the privacy policies of those third parties. If you are
                    interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies
                    from being put on your devices to deliver tailored advertising, you may visit the Network Advertising Initiative's
                    Consumer Opt-Out link or the Digital Advertising Alliance's Consumer Opt-Out link to opt out of receiving
                    tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs.</p>

                    <p>For additional ways to opt-out of targeted advertising activities under applicable laws, see the
                    “Your Choices and Rights” section below.</p>

                    <p>Please note that these opt-outs apply per browser and per device, so you will have to opt out for
                    each device—and each browser on each device—through which you access our Products. In addition, the
                    opt-outs do not apply to advertisements in mobile applications. See the “Mobile App and In-Product Advertising”
                    section below to learn how to opt out of mobile app advertising.</p>
                    <h3>MOBILE APP AND IN-PRODUCT ADVERTISING</h3>

                    <p>You may also receive tailored in-app advertisements when using our mobile apps. We may use
                    third-party service providers to deliver ads on mobile apps or for mobile app analytics. Each operating system (for
                    example iOS for Apple phones, Android for Android devices, and Windows for Microsoft devices) provides its own
                    instructions on how to express certain choices regarding the delivery of tailored in-application advertisements.
                    Because we do not control how the applicable Platform Operator enables these choices receiving personalized
                    in-application advertisements, you should review the support materials and/or the device settings for the
                    respective operating systems for information on opting out of tailored in-application advertisements. We do not share
                    your age or gender with third parties to enable them to deliver targeted advertising to you based on your age or
                    gender in our mobile apps, except that we may inform third parties if we know that you are under the age of
                    consent (see Section 8: Children's Information).</p>

                    <p>Further information about the protection of your privacy can be found in the relevant third party
                    entity's privacy policy. For links to these, and details of partners who are integrated into our mobile

                    <h3>NOTICE CONCERNING DO NOT TRACK</h3>

                    <p>Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that is available in certain web browsers. We do not
                    currently recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals. Please note that Do Not Track is a different
                    privacy mechanism than the user “preference signal” referenced in the “Your Choices and Rights” section
                    below, which is a legally recognized browser-based control that indicates whether you would like to opt out of
                    processing of your personal information for certain purposes, such as the “sale” or “sharing” of your information
                    or the disclosure of your personal information for targeted advertising purposes, under applicable laws.</p>

                    We place great importance on the steps we take, including physical, technical and organisational
                    measures, to protect your personal information from unauthorized access and against unlawful processing,
                    accidental loss, destruction and damage. However, no method of transmission over the internet, and no means of
                    electronic or physical storage, is absolutely secure. We cannot guarantee the security of your personal
                    information transmitted to, through, or on our Products and that any such transmission is at your own risk.</p>

                    your username, and/or password. If you suspect unauthorized access, you should change your password,
                    using a strong password immediately.</p>
                    <p>
                    We will retain your personal information for the duration of your use or access to our Products and

                    necessary to meet our tax reporting requirements as well as time required to fulfil transactions you have requested,
                    enforce any obligations in our agreements, any game “sun-setting” requirements or to identify, issue or resolve
                    legal proceedings or disputes, fraud prevention, and related security purposes. In determining how long to
                    retain information, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the information, the potential risk
                    of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of the information, the purposes for which we process the

                    to that in the EU, through its domestic law or its international commitments. Such third parties may be engaged
                    in, among other things, the provision of our Products to you, the processing of transactions, and/or the
                    provision of support services. By providing us with your personal information, you acknowledge any such transfer,
                    storage, or use.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Where SEGA transfers personal information it will seek to take account of any applicable legal
                    obligations relevant to personal information transfers. In the case of transfers of personal information out of
                    the European Economic Area, it will, in the absence of an EC adequacy decision relevant to the destination country, seek to rely on appropriate safeguards such as the EC approved standard contractual clauses relevant to
                    personal information transfers between data controllers or between a data controller and a data processor
                    (see https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en).

                    <p>
                    Several of our mobile products serve advertising, and some of our partners collect data directly
                    from your device. Depending on your region and device, you have choices regarding our partners' access to
                    certain data like your device ID and device geo-location data.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Certain Mobile Products are currently supported by third party advertising partners that serve
                    advertisements (“Third Party Advertisers”), including behavioural, location or interest based advertising
                    (“Interest Based Advertising”) within our Products. These Third Party Advertisers use technology to serve the
                    advertisements and link to them directly into our Products. They may automatically receive your device ID, IP address
                    or geo-location data (limited to country/region) when this happens.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Please see the list of Third Party Advertisers and Partners in Appendix A used within certain
                    Products, and their respective privacy policies for information regarding their privacy practices.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Your mobile device may provide you with the ability to limit access to your device IDs and device
                    geo-location data through settings on your device.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Please note that if you opt out of certain Interest Based Advertising, you may continue to receive
                    contextual ads based on other non-personal information, such as ads related to the content of the Product you
                    are using.

                    <h3>Opt-Out for Location Data</h3>
                    <p>
                    Certain Third Party Advertisers in Products may collect (with your permission) precise location
                    data, or street-level location information, about you (“Precise Location Data”). Your mobile device may allow
                    you to opt out of the collection of Precise Location Data by the Third Party Advertiser in the Product through
                    settings on your device. Please note that your mobile device will not share location information without your
                    permission.
