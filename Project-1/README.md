OVERVIEW
I elected to make my site about the SEGA GENESIS video game console, which originally launched in 1989.
It is immediately worth noting that some of the content on the site technically came out after the release of the world wide web in 1993
My reason for including games and accessories from 1994 is so that I could have more content on the site.
The time frame intended for this site is just on the cusp of the launch of sega saturn and sega 32x, both released at the end of 1994.
For the sake of the project requirements, assume this site existed since the launch of the GENESIS, and the current iteration is the end of it's lifespan.
