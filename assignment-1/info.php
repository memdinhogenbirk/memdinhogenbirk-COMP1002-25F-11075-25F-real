	<h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
	<p>Here at Papapia Pizzeria, we do not value your privacy at all. In fact, every interaction with our webpage is immediately documented and shipped off to a Siberian scammer operation. We know this may upset you, but if you saw how much they were paying us, you'd understand. I'm talking enough money that we don't even have to sell a single pizza to keep this whole thing afloat. Our CEO Doug has four Maseratis, two houses, and a private island that he got for a steal, bought it off some fella named Jeffery I think. Theres about 47 pages of legal jargin that makes all this possible, but you're not gonna read any of that now are you? So here's the lyrics to "A Criminal Mind" by Gowan instead.<br><br>

	<p cite="a criminal mind by gowan lyrics" href="https://genius.com/Gowan-a-criminal-mind-lyrics">
		[Verse 1]
		You see my hands are steady
		You've seen my face before
		Soon you can take your last look
		And they'll close the door

		[Verse 2]
		I stand accused before you
		I have no tears to cry
		And you will never break me
		Till the day I die

		[Chorus]
		A criminal mind is all I
		All I've ever known
		They tried to reform me
		But I'm made of cold stone
		My criminal mind is all I
		All I've ever had
		Ask one who's known me
		If I'm really so bad
		I am

		[Verse 3]
		I've spent my life behind these steel bars
		I've paid my debt in time
		But being brought to justice
		That was my only crime

		[Verse 4]
		I don't regret a single action
		I'd do the same again
		These prison walls secure me
		And I'm numb to pain

		[Chorus]
		A criminal mind is all I
		All I've ever known
		They tried to reform me
		But I'm made of cold stone
		My criminal mind is all I
		All I've ever had
		Ask one who's known me
		If I'm really so bad
		I am

		[Instrumental Break]

		[Verse 5]
		Before you hand me over
		Before you read my sentence
		I'd like to say a few words
		Here in my own defense

		[Verse 6]
		Some people struggle daily
		They struggle with their conscience till the end
		I have no guilt to haunt me
		I feel no wrong intent
		[Chorus]
		A criminal mind is all I
		All I've ever known
		Don't try to reform me
		'Cause I'm made of cold stone
		My criminal mind is all I
		All I've ever had
		Ask one who's known me
		If I'm really so bad
		I am
		Oh, I am
		Oh, I am
		I'm made of cold stone
		Made of cold stone
		I'm just like these prison walls
		A criminal mind
		Oh
		Made of cold stone
		I'm made of cold stone
		I'm just like your prison walls
		I'm made of cold stone
		I got a criminal mind
		I am
		A criminal mind
		A criminal mind
		Just like your prison walls<br><br>
